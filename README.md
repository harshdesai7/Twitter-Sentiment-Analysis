# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

#Objective: 
To Design a model to extract, identify and characterize sentitment of the Tweet

#Sentiment Analysis
Inorder to extract live data from twitter API we have made use of Tweepy (Python library for accessing the Twitter API)

We wanted to train the model on a constant data. As the streaming data keeps changing, we have done the predictions using stream data 
.which was exported into a csv
This data set has two different polarities i.e. negative and positive
We would be predicting the outcome in the label column
Sampled Labeled Data is taken from Sentiment-140 Dataset.
